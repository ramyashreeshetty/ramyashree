## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I'm **Ramyashree**! This is my unofficial, chaotic, and totally fun introduction to the world.

This project was born out of a challenge:
1.  **The Challenge**: My friend dared me to build something by the end of the year.
2.  **The Context**: I participated in the **Girls Leading Tech** hackathon.
3.  **The Constraint**: I started late and had only **4 hours** to build this.
4.  **The Result**: A nostalgia-fueled Windows XP desktop simulator because... why not?

I have an old, serious portfolio somewhere, but let's be honest—this one shows my true "freakin' weird" side.

## 🌟 Features

Step into the time machine (circa 2001):

*   **🪟 Fully Functional Desktop**: Move windows around, minimize them, and enjoy the classic Bliss wallpaper.
*   **🐱 Cat Mascot**: A helpful (and slightly sassy) cat who drops facts about me (hover/click for tips!).
*   **🌸 Flower Garden**: A chill zone to plant digital flowers because we all need to touch grass sometimes.
*   **🎵 Music Player**: Built-in tunes to vibe to while you stalk my projects.
*   **📂 Interactive Apps**:
    *   **About Me**: Learn about my journey as a **Data Engineer**.
    *   **Projects**: See what else I've built (besides this OS).
    *   **Hobbies**: Anime, Gaming, and more.
    *   **Contact**: Send me a digital mail.
